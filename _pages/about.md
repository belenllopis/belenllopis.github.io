I am a PhD student at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, in the [Thermal Area of the Institute of Energy Engineering](http://www.iie.upv.es/staff/thermal-area-staff).
<br>
My main area of research is based on the Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) of soft faults in heat pumps and air conditioning systems, but I also do research on the design and optimisation of these equipments and their components.
<br>
For computation during my research, I like to use R and Python to analyse data and represent it and I enjoy using LaTeX to write beautiful reports and papers.
<br>
Feel free to contact me if you want to know more about me!
