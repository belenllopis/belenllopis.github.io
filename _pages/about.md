I am a PhD student at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, in the [Thermal Area of the Institute of Energy Engineering](https://iie.webs.upv.es/).
<br>
<br>
For my doctoral studies, my primary research is focused on the Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) of soft faults in heat pumps and air conditioning systems, but I also work in the development and optimization of refrigeration equipment, heat pumps, and their components.
<br>
<br>
For computation during my research, I like to use R and Python to analyze data and represent it and I enjoy using LaTeX to write nice reports and papers.

Feel free to contact me if you want to know more about me!
